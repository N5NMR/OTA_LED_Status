This File will help you to connect to the WIFI and will indicate the Status via the Buildin LED.
Works for ESP32DEV and ESP8266 Wemos D1 Mini
You can change the LED in the wifi_connect.h in the ESP32 Section (#define LED_BUILTIN 2)
ESP8266 works with the definition LED_BUILTIN
I always take this Code as an Beginning for other Code.
